BlenderSciViz
=============

Preliminary code for plotting data in Blender.

###What this project hopes to achieve?  
Create analogues for common plotting needs in the scientific and data community. Provide sufficiently readable 
examples as a foundation for maximum customization by those willing to learn.

###TODO

**Useful code snippets and addons**

- 1d array to point cloud (scatter plot), takes array of {x,y,z} tuples and generates vertices
- 2d array to 3d mesh, takes n*n array of {x,y,z} tuples and generates a mesh
- Automatic colour map for 3d mesh data
